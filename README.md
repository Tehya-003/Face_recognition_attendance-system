## üì∏Face Recognition Attendance System
 Welcome to the Face Recognition Attendance System! This innovative project leverages Amazon Rekognition, a live webcam feed, and MySQL to create a seamless and efficient attendance recording system.

### üöÄ Features
- **Real-time Face Recognition**: Capture photos in real-time using your webcam.
- **AWS Rekognition Integration**: Identify faces using Amazon Rekognition.
- **Automated Attendance Recording**: Store attendance records in a MySQL database.
- **Attendance Calculation**: Calculate attendance based on a default 30-day period.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive Tkinter GUI.

### üõ† Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- Tkinter
- OpenCV
- Pillow
- Boto3
- PyODBC
- MySQL
- MySQL ODBC 8.0 Driver
- AWS Account with Rekognition and DynamoDB configured

# üì¶ Installation:

# Install Python Dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Install MySQL ODBC Driver:
 #### Download and install the MySQL ODBC 8.0 Driver from [**MySQL's official website**](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/odbc/).

# üéÆ Usage
**Start the Application**:

```bash
python facerecognition.py
```

# Interact with the GUI:

- Start Webcam: Opens the webcam and starts the live feed.
- Stop Webcam: Stops the webcam feed.
- Capture Photo: Captures a photo, recognizes the face, and records attendance.

# üóÑÔ∏è Database Setup
 1.**Create the Necessary Tables**:
```sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE employees (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE attendance (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    employee_id INT NOT NULL,
    employee_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    status VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    date DATE NOT NULL,
    time TIME NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (employee_id) REFERENCES employees(id)
);
```
 2.**Insert Employee Data**:
Populate the employees table with employee names and IDs.

# ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration
 1. **AWS Configuration**:
Ensure AWS credentials are set up and that you have created a Rekognition collection named **famouspersons** and a DynamoDB table named **facerecognition**.

 2. **MySQL Configuration**:
Update the **db_config** dictionary in **facerecognition.py** with your MySQL database credentials.
``` ini
python
db_config = {
    'DRIVER': '{MySQL ODBC 8.0 Driver}',
    'SERVER': 'localhost',
    'DATABASE': 'your_database_name',
    'UID': 'your_username',
    'PWD': 'your_password'
}
```
# üìä Attendance Calculation
Attendance is calculated based on a default 30-day period. If an employee is present, their attendance is recorded as a fraction (e.g., 1/30) and updated each day they are recognized.

# üìÇ Additional Scripts
# putimages.py
This script uploads images to an S3 bucket and assigns metadata to each image.

# lambdafunction.py
This AWS Lambda function indexes faces in the S3 bucket using Rekognition and updates a DynamoDB table with the face ID and full name.

# Breaking Down the Repo
At first glance, the files in the repo may look intimidating and overwhelming. To avoid that, here is a quick guide:

- `.gitignore`: Specifies which files/folders to ignore when committing.
- `facerecognition.py`: The main script that runs the face recognition and attendance system.
- `putimages.py`:Script to upload images to S3 with metadata
- `lambdafunction.py`:AWS Lambda function to index faces and update DynamoDB.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies needed for the project.
- `README.md`: This readme file.

# How it Works
**Start the Application**:

- Run **python facerecognition.py** to launch the application.
- Use the buttons in the GUI to start/stop the webcam and capture photos.
- 
**Capture and Recognize**:

- When you capture a photo, the image is saved locally and analyzed by AWS Rekognition.
- The system checks if the recognized face matches any employee in the database.
- Attendance is recorded in the MySQL database with the employee's ID, name, status, date, and time.
  
**Attendance Calculation**:

- Attendance is tracked over a 30-day period.
- Each presence is recorded as a fraction of the total period (e.g., 1/30).
- Daily attendance is updated automatically.
